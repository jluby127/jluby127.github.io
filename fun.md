### Grand Ideas, Simple Measurements

In addition to my research, I enjoy creating informational videos on astronomy, aimed at the curious beginner.

I am creating a series of videos, which I am calling "Grand Ideas, Simple Measurements", where I attempt to explain some of the techniques that astronomers use to make various measurements of the universe. Astronomy is unique among the sciences in that we cannot interact with our test subjects. We can only observe them from a (very far!) distance. All of astronomy is essentially "collecting" photons, and it has always been incredible to me how much information can be extracted from light. Some of the biggest questions of humankind can have been answered by highly clever, yet remarkably simple measurements using little more than photons (or lack thereof!). In this series, I set out to explain how some of our biggest questions are answered in simple ways.

When I say "simple" I do not mean to imply that the experiment itself is somewhat trivial, not at all! I only mean to suggest that the theory behind the measurements, the many ideas which, together, build up to create the foundational support for why such a measurement works, those are sometimes quite elegantly simple.

The first video in the series describes the Rossiter-McLaughlin and how we use it to learn about the dynamical history of planets and their formation.

### Short Story Writing

I have always loved reading Sci-Fi and in my mind the next logical step is to write Sci-Fi. In the past few years writing has grown to into one of my favorite hobbies. I find it relaxing, yet challenging. Up to now, I've stuck to short stories, one day I might like to try something longer.

Here is an abbreviated and slowing growing bibliography with short synopses. As of now, I only circulate these among friends and family. One day perhaps they will see a wider audience.

<ul type="disc">
    <li> <b> SquidWorld </b> - A squid-themed amusement park built atop the ice sheets of Jupiter's third largest moon, Europa. In the oceans below, a population of giant squid deliberately seeded here by scientists swim and hunt the indigenous fauna. Explore and learn all about this cephalopod sanctuary...</li>

    <br>

    <li> <b> Teacups </b> - A society built on the edge of civilization in the Canadian northern plains has a single goal for which all the members strive for unrelentingly. When a new member joins, she thinks she understands it all, until the curtain is slowly pulled from her eyes...</li>

    <br>

    <li> <b> All That Glitters </b> - In the decade following a major asteroid impact on the far side of the Moon, NASA reignites its moon landing missions in an effort to study the crater. The first mission is a resounding success, the second goes into routine radio blackout but never emerges. As a nation and the world grieves, a third mission is sent to investigate the crash site and recover the bodies, but not all is as it seems...</li>

    <br>

    <li> <b> Tuesday </b> - In the lead up to the big launch, an astronaut and their partner come to grips with the reality that the ticket is a one way ride. As the goodbye grows nearer, unexplainable events bring them closer together than ever before... </li>

    <br>

    <li> <b> Five Campers </b> - Five strangers find themselves to be the sole Earthly survivors of a nuclear event. As the world burns and crumbles around them, they fight both to survive and to cope with the knowledge that they will be the last humans. How will they memorialize an entire species... </li>
