In addition to my research, I enjoy creating informational videos on astronomy, aimed at the curious beginner.

I am creating a series of videos, which I am calling "Grand Ideas, Simple Measurements", where I attempt to explain some of the techniques that astronomers use to make various measurements of the universe. Astronomy is unique among the sciences in that we cannot interact with our test subjects. We can only observe them from a (very far!) distance. All of astronomy is essentially "collecting" photons, and it has always been incredible to me how much information can be extracted from light. Some of the biggest questions of humankind can have been answered by highly clever, yet remarkably simple measurements using little more than photons (or lack thereof!). In this series, I set out to explain how some of our biggest questions are answered in simple ways.

The first video in the series describes the Rossiter-McLaughlin and how we use it to learn about the dynamical history of planets and their formation.

Coming attractions include:

Size of the Earth

Earth to Stars distance
