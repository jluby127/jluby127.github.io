### My Bookshelf

Few things are better than a good book. For me, most "good" books are Sci-Fi, though this is not a hard rule. I tend to read sci-fi in the summer, because I like to read these stories outside in the sunshine, preferably on the beach or in a green park. Then I read non-fiction history books in the winter, because for reasons I can't fully explain, I like to read these on dark and cold nights. Here is an abbreviated list of some of my favorites, in no particular order.

### Short Story Writing

Having always loved reading Sci-Fi, in my mind the next logical step is to write Sci-Fi. In the past few years writing has grown to into one of my favorite hobbies. I find it relaxing, yet challenging. Up to now, I've stuck to short stories, one day I might like to try something longer.

Here is a slowing growing bibliography with short synopses. As of now, I only circulate these among friends and family (Feel free to ask if you want read, I'll likely say yes). One day perhaps they will see a wider audience.
