I primarily search for exoplanets using the radial velocity (rv) detection method and 
I have taken a particular fascination with multi-planet systems.
I am further interested in stellar activity as it relates to making planet detection more difficult,
and signal analysis/processing in general.

I work with [Prof. Paul Robertson](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/robertson/) on a variety of projects, such as:

Previously, as an undergraduate at Vanderbilt, I worked with Prof. Keivan Stassun and (now postdoc 
at harvard cfa) Dr. Joseph Rodriguez on double M dwarf eclipsing binaries. 
we discovered and characterized the second brightest known of these such systems.
