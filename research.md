<strong>A little bit about my research</strong>

<br>
<br>
<br>

I primarily search for exoplanets using the radial velocity (RV) detection method but I am further interested in intersection of stellar activity and planet hunting. Stellar activity induced signals can mask or masquerade as planets. In this new era of high precision instrumentation which allows us to probe below the 1 m/s signal threshold, we are finding that such stellar activity will be a persistent nuisance in the search for low mass and/or long period planets.

Someday I might like to get my hands a little dirty with an instrumentation project...

Here I am at Cape Canaveral with friends test driving an Apollo capsule model. All systems go!  ----->

I work with [Paul Robertson](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/robertson/) on a variety of projects, such as:

<strong>Building a Better Periodogram:</strong>

Stellar activity is a real nuisance when planet hunting via RV. Activity induced signals,
from phenomena like star spots, can either mask a true planetary signal or mimic a planet causing false positive detections.
These signals are inherently tied to the rotation period of the star. The phenomena responsible have varying lifetimes and decay rates across different stellar classifications.
So how can we determine if a signal is planetary or activity without waiting years hoping that the signal won't disappear?
We need a better periodogram, one which can not only tell us the periodicity of a signal, but the decay time of the signal as well.


<strong>Spin-Orbit Misalignment:</strong>

As more planets are discovered and more can be fully characterized and scrutinized, astronomers are finding that planets don't always
align nicely with their star. That is to say the orbital plane of the planet is not exactly perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the host star. In our Solar System, the largest misalignment belongs to Mercury at just under 7 degrees.
But in extrasolar planets, astronomers are finding inclinations at every value between 0 and +/- 180 degrees (negative values indicate that the planet orbits in the opposite direction of the star's spin...a "backwards" or retrograde orbit).
This phenomena has important implications for our understanding of how planets form but more data is needed, we need more well measured systems.

<strong>And more...</strong>

As an undergraduate at Vanderbilt, I worked with Professor [Keivan Stassun](http://astro.phy.vanderbilt.edu/~stassuk/) and (now Assistant Professor at Michigan State University) [Joseph Rodriguez](https://sites.google.com/site/josepherodriguezjr/) on double M dwarf eclipsing binaries.
We discovered and characterized the second brightest known of these such systems with the hope that the tight constraints we placed on mass, radius, and temperature can assist the theorists in refining their models of low mass stars.
