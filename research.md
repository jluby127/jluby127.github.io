i primarily search for exoplanets using the radial velocity (rv) detection method and 
i have taken a particular fascination with multi-planet systems.
i am further interested in stellar activity as it relates to making planet detection more difficult,
and signal analysis/processing in general.

i work with [prof. paul robertson](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/robertson/) on a variety of projects, such as:

previously, as an undergraduate at vanderbilt, i worked with prof. keivan stassun and (now postdoc 
at harvard cfa) dr. joseph rodriguez on double m dwarf eclipsing binaries. 
we discovered and characterized the second brightest known of these such systems.
