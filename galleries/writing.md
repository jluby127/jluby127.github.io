### Short Story Writing

I have always loved reading Sci-Fi and in my mind the next logical step is to write Sci-Fi. In the past few years, writing has grown to into one of my favorite hobbies. I find it relaxing, yet challenging. Up to now, I've stuck to short stories, one day I might like to try something longer. Someday I may also like to try to pursue some kind of publication. That said, they would need some major updates in terms of general editing, story clarity, style, and more. But for now, I write stories just for an audience of me (and some friends).

Here is slowing growing bibliography with short synopses.
